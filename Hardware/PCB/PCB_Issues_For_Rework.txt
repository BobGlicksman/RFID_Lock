PCB Issues for rework in Rev 1:

1.  The D24V5F3 voltage regulator appears to need some inductance on the VOUT motor supply.  At least, it works OK with jumpers.
2.  The buzzer part needs to be changed to have the correct pin spacing.
3.  The transistor silkscreen is backward; perhaps the package is wrong.
4.  R7 and R8 pulldowns are unnecessary and should be replaced.
